/* ==========================================================================
   THE BARCODE ENGINE - the single definition of how many barcodes a received
   quantity produces, and what each one stands for.

   The rule the client specified, in full:

     UOM   TYPE     QTY   BARCODES   EACH BARCODE REPRESENTS
     ---   ------   ---   --------   -----------------------
     PC    batch      1          1   the whole batch (1 pc)
     PC    batch      5          1   the whole batch (5 pc)
     PC    unique     5          5   1 pc
     MTR   batch      5          1   the whole batch (5 mtr)
     MTR   unique     5          5   1 cut each (metres per cut)

   Read as one rule rather than four cases:

     batch  -> ONE barcode carrying the entire quantity
     unique -> ONE barcode per unit; UOM decides what a "unit" is
               (PC: one piece. MTR: one cut, carrying that cut's metres.)

   This was previously implemented inside the Barcode Generation screen only
   (components/GCRBarcodeGeneration.jsx buildBarcodePlan), in the browser,
   with a client-held running sequence. That meant POS, stock transfer,
   receiving, returns and the reports each had to re-derive what a barcode
   meant from free text, and two operators generating at once could issue the
   same number. Both problems are fixed by moving the rule here and the
   numbering onto an atomic counter.

   Nothing in this module touches the database except to reserve numbers.
   ========================================================================== */

/* uomTypeOf and batchTypeOf live in ./barcodeUnits.js - pure, so the label
   printing rule reads a unit exactly the way this engine does, in the browser

   of them from this module keeps working. */

   cut. When it is absent or does not add up, the total is divided evenly,
   with the rounding remainder put on the last cut so the plan always sums to
   exactly the received quantity.

     was transferred. Including the format means rolling into a new period
     (a new prefix) starts that prefix's own series rather than continuing the

/* Where the series is not allowed to start below.

   TWO floors, both applied through ensureFloor's $max, so they can only ever
   move the series FORWARD and applying them twice changes nothing:

     1. START NUMBER from the Barcode Setting master. This was simply never
        read - loadFormat returned prefix/suffix/width and dropped it - so
        reserveSequence upserted a counter at 0 and issued 1. A master
        configured "Prefix 9A, Start Number 1000" previewed 9A1000 on the
        settings screen (lib/barcodeFormat.js DOES use startNumber) and then
        generated 9A0001, which is the whole bug.

        It is re-applied on every reservation rather than only when the
        counter is created, because a series whose counter already exists -
        9A was sitting at 28 - would otherwise keep ignoring the number the
        operator configured. Raising Start Number therefore takes effect;
        lowering it deliberately does not, since $max never walks a counter
        back onto numbers already issued.

     2. THE HIGHEST NUMBER ALREADY PRINTED under this prefix, read once when
        the counter does not exist yet. Without it a Start Number set BELOW
        what has already been issued would reissue live labels - a duplicate
        on physical goods, which no later correction can undo. The scan is
        one-time: once the counter exists it is itself the record, and a
        full-collection scan on every save would not be defensible. */
