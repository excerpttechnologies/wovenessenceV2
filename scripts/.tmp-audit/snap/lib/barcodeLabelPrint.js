/* ==========================================================================
   BARCODE LABEL PRINTING - which barcode type a row is, how many stickers it
   gets, and what may be printed on them.

   Client-safe and pure, so the SAME function runs on the server (GET
   /api/grc/[id] stamps every row with barcodeType / labelCount) and in the
   browser (the Barcode Generation print picker - preview AND print run - and
   the GRC Barcode Print page, for rows that exist only on screen until they
   are saved). One definition; nothing re-derives it anywhere else.

   WHERE THE TYPE COMES FROM - the fields Barcode Generation writes onto every
   barcodeLabel row (app/api/barcode-generation/route.js buildDocs):
     uomType    'PC' | 'MTR'        from the row's uom, which the Add Item
                                    form sets from its MTR checkbox
     batchType  'unique' | 'batch'  from its Unique Barcode checkbox - ticked
                                    is unique, unticked is batch
   The Item master's own uniqueBarcode is NOT read: 141 of its 143 items still
   carry the schema default "No", while most generated barcodes are unique.

   THE COUNT RULE
     MTR     1 barcode -> 2 labels
     UNIQUE  1 barcode -> 1 label
     BATCH   1 barcode -> the number the operator enters, never more than the
                          quantity that batch barcode stands for

   These are PRINT copies. Every copy carries the same barcode number, and
   nothing in this module reserves, generates or saves a barcode - so printing
   two stickers for a metre barcode cannot move the barcode sequence, and
   printing twenty-five for a batch cannot create twenty-four more records.

   Built by WHITELIST: a field not named below cannot reach a sticker however
   the row it came from is shaped. That is the point. A barcode row carries
   supplierId, and the screens that feed the printer have at various times
   added supplierName, supplierCode, grcNo, grcNumber and billSlNo to it -
   some for label display, others not. They remain on the barcode row, the
   GRC and every report; only what's explicitly whitelisted here reaches paper.

   Both the saved shape (purRate, finalNet, qtyNum, batchType) and the
   generation grid's shape (purchaseRate, finalPrice, qty, uniqueBarcode) are
   accepted, so a row does not have to be re-mapped before it is printed.

   worded it, which is product text, not the vendor's identity - exactly as
