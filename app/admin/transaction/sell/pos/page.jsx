/* WHEN THE BILL WAS RUNG UP - the day and the clock, from two fields.

   They mean different things and only one of them carries a time:

     date       the business date the till's date picker holds. Stored at
                midnight, ALWAYS - so asking for it as a datetime prints
                00:00:00 against every bill on the screen.
     createdAt  written by the timestamps option on models/PosInvoice.js when
                the invoice is saved. This is the real moment of the sale.

   So the day comes from `date`, which is also what the Start Date / End Date
   filter matches - taking the day from createdAt instead would put a row in
   the column that a search for its own date would not find - and the clock
   comes from createdAt.

   The time is shown ONLY when the two fall on the same day. A bill dated
   yesterday but rung up this morning would otherwise be stamped with a time
   belonging to a different day, which is worse than showing no time at all.

   Read with the local getters, exactly as fmt('date') in lib/format.js does,
   so the day this prints is the same day the column printed before. */

  /* to the SECOND. Two bills rung up in the same minute are ordinary at a
     counter, and without seconds the list gives no way to tell which came
     first - the rows are sorted on it, so the order looked arbitrary.

     On a 12-HOUR clock. Note the two cases a naive `hours % 12` gets wrong,
     both of which are trading hours: midday is 12 PM, not 0 PM, and midnight
     is 12 AM. `|| 12` turns the zero back into twelve for both. */

/* WHAT THE BILL WAS ACTUALLY PAID WITH.

   Read from the payments array, NOT from billingType. billingType is the
   dropdown at the top of the till and stays on whatever it was left at -
   invoice 0045 is stored as Cash while its only payment is 600 on UPI/Card,
   so trusting it would print the wrong method on the screen.

   Multiple Pay writes a row for EVERY method it offers, including the ones
   left empty, so only rows carrying an amount count. Repeats are collapsed:
   a bill split across two cash entries is still cash, and a genuine split
   reads "CASH + UPI/CARD".

   Falls back to billingType for a bill with no payment rows at all - older
   invoices predate the Multiple Pay dialog - and to nothing when there is
   neither, rather than inventing a method. */
