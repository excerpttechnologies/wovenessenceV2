/* Roles & Permissions - the data behind the screen.

   THE RESOURCE LIST IS THE SIDEBAR. It is derived from config/nav.js at
   module load rather than typed out here, because a permission list that is
   maintained by hand goes stale the first time somebody adds a screen and
   forgets: the new page would then be invisible to the permission editor
   while being perfectly reachable in the app. Deriving it means adding an
   entry to NAV adds its permissions, and removing one removes them.

   One resource per sidebar leaf, keyed by href - the href is already unique
   and already stable, so it needs no second identifier invented for it.

   FRONTEND ONLY FOR NOW. Nothing here is fetched and nothing is saved. The
   matrix below is the seed the screen opens with, and edits live in React
   state until the API is built. When it is, ROLES / ACTIONS / RESOURCES stay
   as the description of the shape; only the default grants and SAMPLE_USERS
   get replaced by real reads.

   Role names are spelled exactly as lib/rbac.js already enforces them, so the
   screen and the server cannot disagree about what a role is called. */
