/* ==========================================================================
   Enforcing the matrix saved on Staff Management -> Roles & Permissions.

   WIRED INTO EXACTLY ONE SCREEN so far: Inter Company Sell -> Delivery
   Challan. Every other route is untouched and still behaves as it always
   has. Switching the rest on is a route-by-route decision, and doing it in
   one sweep would change what a hundred screens allow without anybody having
   asked for that.

   THE RULE THAT KEEPS TODAY WORKING:

     no saved override for the role  ->  ALLOW
     a saved override                ->  allow only what it grants

   That is the whole safety story. Nothing changes for anybody until an
   administrator saves a matrix for their role, and when they do, it applies
   only to the screens that have been wired. The alternative - enforcing the
   code defaults from lib/rbac.js - would have quietly restricted every role
   the moment this shipped, which is not what "add validation" asked for.

   Super Admin is never checked - it is the installation's owner, and a stored
   document must not be able to lock the last way in. Admin IS checked: it is
   the top role a customer administers, so it has to be narrowable.

   RETURNS A DENIAL, IT DOES NOT THROW. The routes this is called from answer
   with Response.json directly and are not wrapped in lib/apiError handler(),
   so a throw would surface as an unhandled 500 rather than a 403. Callers do:

     const denial = await screenDenial({ session, screen, action, businessId });
     if (denial) return json({ error: denial.message, code: denial.code }, 403);
